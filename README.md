# Better Data Formats for Faster Analysis

## Description

Have you ever tried to load a large CSV file and waited minutes for it to
appear? CSV files can be slow to read, memory-intensive, and difficult to

types. You’ll see how to use Parquet with pandas, Polars, or DuckDB to improve
workflow efficiency and reproducibility.
